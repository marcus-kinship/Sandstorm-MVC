                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free software license
that allows you to run, share, and modify the software while
providing certain conditions to protect the freedom of users.

This version of the License applies to any program or other work
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
it may be distributed under the terms of this License. You can
apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public
License, permits more flexibility in linking with non-free programs,
while still preserving your rights to the library itself.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS
